# Google Data Analytics Capstone Project

## Project Overview
This data analysis case study is a capstone project for the [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics?).

## Introduction and Scenario
In this case study, I am a data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at [Bellabeat](https://bellabeat.com), a high-tech manufactuerer of health-focused products for women. The CCO of Bellabeat believes that analyzing smart device fitness could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company.

I am tasked with focusing on one of Bellabeat's products and analyzing smart device usage data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. The insights I discover will help guide marketing strategy for the company. This analysis will be delivered to the Bellabeat executive team along with my high-level recommendations for Bellabeat's marketing strategy.  

## Roadmap of the Analysis
I began this project by asking relevant questions to help guide my analysis.
- What are some trends in smart device usage?
- How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
- How could these trends help influence Bellabeat's marketing strategy?

After contemplating these questions I arrived at the roadmap below.

### Guiding Questions
- Does Bellabeat's marketing strategy align with how consumers use their smart devices?
- Are consumers using their non-Bellabeat devices differently?

### Key Tasks
- The business task is to analyze smart device usage data to learn how consumers use their devices.
- The key stakeholders are Bellabeat's CCO, Bellabeat's cofounder, and the marketing strategy leaders.

### Deliverables 
Based on the business task and the scenario, I have identified the following delvierables:
- Analysis of how consumers use their devices.
- Apply insights to one of Bellabeats products.
- Provide high-level recommendations.
- Presentation of findings for the executive team.

## Data Source
![kaggle](https://github.com/Mishkanian/Google_Data_Analytics_Capstone/blob/main/README_images/kaggle.png)
The CCO of Bellabeat encouraged me to use the [FitBit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit) from Kaggle. This dataset contains personal fitness tracking data from 30 fitbit users. All of these users have consented to the submission of this data. This data is CC0: Public Domain, which means that it is not under copyright restrictions. This data can be copied, modified, distributed, and even used for commercial purposes without asking permission.

A possible limitation of this data is that it was gathered in Q2 2016. In the rapidly advancing consumer electronics industry, a five year gap in data could lead to potentially inaccurate results that are not reflective of the current consumer climate. If given more time or resources, I would either conduct a new survey to capture more relevant data or request an extension to find a more relevant data source. My concerns about this data will be included in the final presentation to the stakeholders.

## Tools for Analysis

Since the FitBit dataset is a collection of multiple CSV files, I have chosen to use **SQL (Google BigQuery)** and **Tableau** to conduct the analysis. For the presenation to the executive team, I have chosen to use Google Slides.

While inspecting and cleaning the data, I will maintain accurate documentation to track all queries, transformations, and processes.
